As the lead front end developer (of a team of 6), I worked closely with the Brand Studio and Growth teams to get over 100 pages updated into the new brand guidelines. The team and I were able to deliver on time with what was noted to be the &quot;smoothest brand launch&quot; anyone has seen at Gusto ü§ò. As a means to document the rebranding process, Figma recently posted <a href='https://www.figma.com/blog/gusto/' target='_blank'rel='noopener noreferrer' class='umami--click--Figma'>a detailed outline of the process on their blog</a>.
