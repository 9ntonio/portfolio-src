This app includes live TV, DVR, and VOD features using integration with MLBAM\'s content delivery service and complex access control features implemented client-side. I was the Technical Director on the project that lasted 2 years. In that time I worked closely with PlayStation on outlining and building not only the applications (iOS and Chromacast), but also the security architecture needed to adhere to their strict security guidelines.',

Our technology powers this unification by providing a robust UI toolkit and HTML style guide for content creators. Part of my tasks as the Technical Director was to digest a 500 page guidelines manual that outlined the technology stack for this massive project that lasted over a year. Afterwards, it was my job to lead the external team assigned to this project to insure that they kept to Sony\'s technical standards as well as onboard new members to the Sony team.',

Along with the front-end reconstruction, we added an extensive watch browser experience so users can search the entire collection at faster speeds. We also created new API\'s to allow users to schedule appointments with stores via the site while also re-platforming the site from Symfony to Laravel.',
